Hello-World
=================

Hi there webworld! I'm Bradley, and I'm still really new to programming. I haven't discovered my language or languages of choice yet, but I'm getting there. 

Today is Jesse Green's last day here at Oakwood. We all had lunch today with Jesse at Frankies, a Mexican food restaurant in Richardson, Texas.
